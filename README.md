# AndrewCLI

A lightweight, fully async Python agent — designed to **keep your context clean**.

Local models degrade fast as context grows: reasoning gets muddier, tool calls go off the rails, and token budgets hit the ceiling. AndrewCLI fights this with two mechanisms that run on every turn:

- **Rolling memory** — after each response, messages are trimmed to just the last exchange and replaced with a compact `~300-word` summary injected into the system prompt. Short exchanges are appended inline with no LLM call, and a dedicated `SUMMARY_MODEL` can be pointed at a smaller model for the background merges.
- **Context-aware router** — before each generation, a local **sentence-embedding classifier** (fastembed, CPU-only) picks the tools and skills needed for the request in ~15 ms. A classic LLM-based router is available as a fallback. Irrelevant schemas never reach the generation prompt.

Both modes (CLI and system tray) share the same core: same domains, same memory, same router, and the same `Domain.busy_lock` that serializes user turns and event dispatches identically on every surface.

An optional **`--voice`** modifier adds wake-word speech-to-text and streaming text-to-speech to either mode. `andrewcli --voice` turns the CLI into a push-to-talk-or-type surface; `andrewcli --tray --voice` does the same for the tray. Voice I/O is additive — typing always works, and the spoken and typed paths produce identical conversation state.

## How Context Stays Clean

### Rolling Memory

After each completed turn:

1. The last 1500 characters of conversation are extracted as an excerpt.
2. **Short-turn fast path** — if the excerpt is under 200 characters (greetings, one-line confirmations, `"Ciao"` / `"grazie"`), it is appended inline with a rolling 2000-char window and **no LLM call is made at all**.
3. If no summary exists yet, the excerpt is saved as-is (capped at 2000 chars).
4. If a summary exists and the turn is long enough, it is **merged with the excerpt** via a background LLM call that produces a single `~300-word` summary — facts, decisions, code written, tools used, user preferences.
5. Messages are **trimmed to just the last exchange** (last user message + last assistant response). The summary is injected into the system prompt inside `<memory>` tags.
6. The merge runs as a **fire-and-forget `asyncio` task** — the next prompt is ready immediately. Sequential merges are serialized with a lock to prevent race conditions.

The model always has prior context, but the message history never grows beyond one exchange. This keeps the effective prompt size bounded regardless of conversation length.

**Dedicated summary model** — summarization is background work that doesn't need the same capacity as the main chat model. Set the `SUMMARY_MODEL` env var (e.g. `qwen2.5-0.5b-instruct`) to route background merges to a smaller model on the same server. Defaults to `MODEL` when unset.

**Storage:** `~/.andrewcli/data/memory.json`

### Context-Aware Router

Before each generation the active router selects a minimal tool/skill set. The generation call receives **only the selected schemas**, not the full catalog. A skill that requires specific tools can declare them in its YAML frontmatter — those are injected even if the router didn't select them. Any routing failure falls back to returning the full catalog so the LLM always has its tools.

Two backends are available, both living in `src/core/router.py` with identical `route()` signatures. The active one is chosen via `router_backend` in `config.yaml`:

| Backend | How it works | Latency | Dependencies |
|---------|--------------|---------|--------------|
| `"embed"` *(default)* | Local sentence-embedding model (`fastembed`, ONNX Runtime, CPU). The catalog is embedded once and cached; each query embedding is compared against it via cosine similarity. Matches above `router_threshold` are returned. | ~15 ms cold, **~0.1 ms cached** | `fastembed` |
| `"llm"` | Classic LLM-as-classifier. Sends prompt + catalog + memory context to the chat model and parses the JSON array it replies with. | 0.5–2 s per turn | None extra |

**Embedding router details**

- Model: `sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2` (~420 MB, 50+ languages). Override with `ROUTER_EMBED_MODEL`.
- **Background warm-up** — `Domain.__init__` kicks off a daemon thread that downloads the model (first run only, to `~/.cache/fastembed`) and pre-embeds the full catalog, so the first real `route()` call hits a fully warm cache.
- **Shared process-wide model cache** — multiple `Domain` instances or per-request routers on the server share one loaded model.
- **32-entry LRU query cache** — retries, follow-ups, and near-duplicate prompts route in sub-millisecond time.
- **Last exchange context** — the previous turn is prepended to the embedded query so follow-ups like "do it again" or "same thing for X" still route correctly.
- **Graceful fallback** — if `fastembed` is missing or the model download fails, `Domain` falls back to the LLM router with a warning; if embedding ever errors at runtime, `route()` returns the full catalog (same safe behavior as the LLM router).
- Threshold tuning — lower `router_threshold` for more recall (fewer missed intents), raise it for more precision (fewer spurious tools). On the shipped catalog, chat/greetings score 0.20–0.35 and real cross-lingual queries score 0.40–0.95, so `0.40` cleanly separates the two classes.

## Architecture

### Config

A centralized `Config` class (`src/shared/config.py`) loads `config.yaml` and exposes settings as attributes. Used by `app.py` to select the active domain, by `ExecuteCommand` to read `execute_bash_automatically`, and by the tray app for window dimensions, position, opacity, and platform backend.

### Domains

A **Domain** groups a system prompt, a set of tools, a set of skills, and a list of events into a single persona. Defined as Python classes in `src/domains/`, loaded dynamically from `config.yaml`. The `generate()` method is an async generator that yields tokens as they stream in. Domains can be **switched at runtime** with TAB.

Each domain owns an `EventBus` instance built from its `events` list. The bus is started by the app layer alongside the main loop.

### Tools

A **Tool** is a Python class the LLM can call. Tools auto-generate their OpenAI function schema from `execute()`'s type hints — no manual schema boilerplate. The base `Tool.run()` wrapper catches exceptions and returns a `[Tool Error]` string so the agent can recover without crashing.

**Built-in tools** (`src/tools/common.py`): `WriteFile`, `ReadFile`, `ExecuteCommand`, `GetCurrentDate`

### Skills

A **Skill** is a markdown-defined tool. Instead of executing code, it returns natural-language instructions that the LLM follows using the available tools. Skill subclasses point to `.md` files in `src/skills/skills_files/` with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: my_skill
description: What this skill does
tools: [tool_name_1, tool_name_2]
---

# Instructions
1. Step one using the available tools
2. Step two using the available tools
```

The optional `tools:` field lists tools the skill requires — they are injected into the generation call even if the router didn't select them.

When invoked, the skill returns its instructions with a `[SKILL INSTRUCTIONS]` prefix that directs the LLM to execute each step via tools rather than summarizing them.

### Events

An **Event** is a self-contained background observer. Each event runs as an asyncio task inside the domain's `EventBus` and defines two things:

- **`condition()`** — an async coroutine that blocks until the triggering condition is met. It can be a sleep, a file-modification check, a queue wait, or any awaitable.
- **`trigger()`** — called once `condition()` returns. Performs any side-effect needed before the agent message is sent.

If the event sets a `message` string, the `EventBus` automatically dispatches it to the agent via `domain.generate_event()` — a fresh, isolated LLM call that never touches the conversation memory or affects routing for user queries.

**Serialization (`Domain.busy_lock`)** — both `domain.generate()` (user turns) and `domain.generate_event()` (event dispatches) acquire a single `asyncio.Lock` on the domain. This means:

- Only one agent interaction streams to the UI at a time.
- Events queue **FIFO** behind each other and behind any in-flight user turn (`asyncio.Lock` wakes waiters in acquisition order).
- A timer event cannot pile up on itself — each event's `_run` loop awaits the full `condition → trigger → notify → dispatch` chain before re-arming.
- The CLI and tray inherit identical behavior without per-surface locks.

**Built-in events** (`src/events/`):

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `TimerEvent` | Fires every N seconds (configurable interval) |
| `FileEvent` | Fires when a watched file's modification time changes |

**Notification** — when an event fires, both surfaces are notified:
- **CLI**: a colored banner (`◆ Event [name]`) is printed, followed by the agent's streamed response.
- **Tray**: a system tray balloon message appears and the panel opens to show the response.

Event responses are rendered exactly like user-initiated responses (routing, spinner, tool calls) but use an isolated LLM instance so the conversation memory is never polluted.

**Defining a new event:**

```python
import asyncio
from src.core.event import Event

class MyEvent(Event):
    name = "my_event"
    description = "Fires when something happens"
    message = "Something happened, please respond."  # sent to agent; omit if no agent call needed

    async def condition(self):
        await asyncio.sleep(30)  # or watch a file, wait on a queue, etc.

    async def trigger(self):
        pass  # optional side-effect before the agent message
```

Add it to your domain's `events` list:

```python
events: list = [
    MyEvent(),
]
```

### UI Layer

- **`Spinner`** (`animations.py`) — async spinner with a dynamic `.status` property. Shows what the agent is doing in real time: `⠴ Thinking...`, `⠧ Running execute_command: ls -la`, `⠋ Loading: write_file, read_file`
- **`ThinkFilter`** (`filter.py`) — streaming parser for `<think>...</think>` tags, handles tags split across token boundaries. Renders reasoning in dim italic while keeping the final answer in normal text
- **`StreamRenderer`** (`renderer.py`) — orchestrates the full output pipeline: spinner lifecycle, `RouteEvent` and `ToolEvent` processing, think filtering, typewriter-effect streaming, ESC-to-stop

### Tray App

A **PyQt6 system tray application** that uses the same domain classes and async logic as the CLI.

- **`worker.py`** — `StreamWorker` QThread runs `domain.generate()` on a shared asyncio event loop via `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`. Emits `token_received`, `tool_status`, `finished`, and `error` signals. Cancellation cancels the asyncio future and sets a flag checked during streaming.
- **`panel.py`** — `ChatPanel` with a `QLineEdit` input, `QTextBrowser` for streamed markdown output, and header controls. Braille spinner (`⠋⠙⠹⠸⠼⠴⠦⠧⠇⠏`) driven by `QTimer` shows tool names during execution and routing. Conversation history is persisted to `~/.andrewcli/data/conversation.md` and restored on next launch.
- **Event bridge** — the `EventBus` runs on the shared asyncio loop. A `queue.SimpleQueue` bridges it to the Qt main thread. A `QTimer` polling at 100 ms drains the queue, shows balloon notifications via `QSystemTrayIcon.showMessage`, and routes tokens to the panel — all without blocking the Qt event loop or the asyncio loop.
- Submitting a new message while generating **cancels the previous generation** and waits before starting a new one.
- **Multi-turn conversations** work because the domain instance (and its memory) persists across all turns.

### Voice (optional)

Passing `--voice` to either the CLI or the tray adds a wake-word-triggered STT pipeline plus sentence-streaming TTS. Everything is optional — if the voice extras aren't installed, the flag is the only thing that touches them, so a plain `andrewcli` run never pays the cost.

- **Single factory** — `src.voice.build_voice_io(config)` constructs the `(stt, tts)` pair from `config.yaml`'s `voice.*` keys. Used by `AndrewCLI`, `AndrewTrayApp`, and the stand-alone `VoiceSession`, so the same config works identically on every surface.
- **Wake-word STT** (`stt.py`) — [`openwakeword`](https://github.com/dscripka/openWakeWord) (tiny ONNX detector, CPU) listens continuously; when the configured word crosses `wake_threshold`, [`faster-whisper`](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) transcribes the captured utterance. CPU threads autodetect (`os.cpu_count()`) so transcription uses every core instead of the 4-thread default. The default wake word is `hey_andrew`, backed by a custom model trained via the openwakeword pipeline and bundled at `src/voice/hey_andrew.onnx`. `_load_wake_model` resolves names in three stages — openwakeword built-ins (`hey_jarvis`, `alexa`, …), then bundled models in `src/voice/<name>.onnx`/`.tflite`, then arbitrary filesystem paths — so swapping in a freshly trained model is just a rename + config change.
- **Adaptive VAD with minimum recording floor** — every utterance is unconditionally recorded for at least 1.5 s (the "floor"); after that, a frame is silent iff `rms < max(silence_rms, 0.35 × peak_rms)` and 800 ms of trailing silence closes the utterance. An 8 s hard cap guarantees progress on hot mics where ambient noise never clears the peak-relative threshold. Whisper's bundled Silero VAD (`vad_filter=True`) then trims leading/trailing noise inside the recorded buffer. The floor is the critical fix: earlier revisions used a plain onset gate that mis-terminated quiet post-wake lulls in under a second.
- **Streaming TTS** — `EdgeTTS` (Microsoft Azure Neural, online, high-quality) or `TextToSpeech` (local Piper, offline, robotic). Both expose a `speak_stream(async_iter)` API that chunks the incoming token stream into sentences and plays each one as it's synthesized, so audio starts within ~500 ms of the first LLM token.
- **Stream teeing** — each assistant response goes to two consumers at once: the normal renderer (CLI stdout or tray panel) and the TTS queue. Implemented via a shared `asyncio.Queue` inside `_stream_response` (CLI) and `StreamWorker._stream` (tray); a sentinel unblocks the consumer on cancellation so TTS stops mid-sentence when the user hits Stop.
- **Markdown pre-render for TTS** — `src.voice.strip_markdown` is a stateful, character-level async filter that sits between the token stream and the TTS queue. It drops `* _ ~ ` # ` (so the speaker doesn't read `**bold**` as "asterisk asterisk bold asterisk asterisk" / "asterisco asterisco grassetto …") and elides the URL portion of `[link](https://...)` while keeping the link text. Stateful across tokens so the `]`→`(` transition works even when the two chars arrive in different chunks. The chat panel / stdout still sees the raw markdown (and renders it visually).
- **CLI integration** — `_get_next_prompt` races the stdin reader against `stt.listen_once()`. Whichever fires first wins and the other is cancelled (termios is restored cleanly). Spoken prompts are echoed to the terminal with a `🎙 ` prefix so the log reads identically whether you typed or spoke. An `on_wake` callback overwrites the prompt line with `🎙 listening...` the instant the wake word fires, so there's visible feedback before you start speaking.
- **Tray integration** — the tray drives `stt.listen_once` in a loop on the background asyncio loop (same one the `StreamWorker` uses for `domain.generate`, so token teeing stays lock-free). Three sentinels flow through a `queue.SimpleQueue` to the 100 ms Qt poller: `__wake__` swaps the status spinner to `🎙 listening...`, a non-empty transcript calls `ChatPanel.show_user_message(text)` + `_on_submit(text)` (producing the same conversation timeline as a typed submit), and `__idle__` (empty transcript — silence after wake or Whisper VAD filtered everything) resets the spinner so the panel never looks stuck on `listening...`.
- **Two-state idle gate** — an `asyncio.Event` (`_voice_idle_event`, on the bg loop) is open iff `user_enabled AND NOT agent_busy`. Two independent flags feed it: `_voice_user_enabled` (flipped by the 🎙/🔇 toggle button in the panel header) and `_voice_agent_busy` (flipped at `_on_submit`/`_event_dispatch` start, cleared on `finished`/`error`/`_on_stop`). When the gate closes it also **cancels the currently-running `listen_once` task**, so the mic goes cold immediately instead of waiting for the next loop iteration — critical for preventing wake-word retrigger mid-turn and self-wake from the tray's own TTS playback bleeding into the mic.
- **Mic toggle button** — a `● Voice` / `○ Voice` toggle in the panel header when `--voice` is active. Green + filled dot = listening; grey + hollow dot = paused. Click to flip; emits `ChatPanel.voice_toggle(bool)` wired to `AndrewTrayApp._on_voice_toggle`. Label is plain ASCII + Unicode bullet rather than a mic emoji so it stays visible on Linux boxes without a color-emoji font installed. The CLI is sequential by construction (`_get_next_prompt` only runs between turns) so it needs no equivalent gate or button.

---

## Async Pipeline

The entire I/O pipeline is non-blocking:

1. **`andrewcli.py`** — runs under `asyncio.run()`. Input read via a custom async `_read_input()` using cbreak mode, supporting TAB and UP/DOWN history.
2. **Router** — either a local embedding cosine-similarity match (default, ~15 ms or sub-ms cached) or an async LLM call, depending on `router_backend`.
3. **Spinner** — `asyncio` task that animates and updates status text from `RouteEvent` and `ToolEvent`s.
4. **Streaming** — `LLM.generate()` is an async generator. Tokens are yielded as they arrive. `ToolEvent` objects are also yielded to update the spinner.
5. **Tool calls** — accumulated from streamed chunks, executed via `tool.run()`, looped back automatically. Malformed JSON arguments are caught and reported instead of crashing.
6. **Memory summarization** — fires in the background after the response completes; no user-facing delay. Skipped entirely for short turns.
7. **Event bus** — runs as a set of concurrent asyncio tasks alongside the main loop. Each event waits on its own `condition()` coroutine independently, then acquires `Domain.busy_lock` to dispatch (FIFO across events and user turns).

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **Voice extras (optional)** — only needed for `--voice`:

   ```bash
   pip install faster-whisper openwakeword sounddevice edge-tts piper-tts
   ```

   Models download automatically to `~/.cache/` on first wake (Whisper ~500 MB for `small`, openwakeword ~15 MB, fastembed router ~420 MB).

2. **Configure your LLM endpoint** via environment variables:

   | Variable | Default | Description |
   |----------|---------|-------------|
   | `API_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:8080/v1` | OpenAI-compatible API URL |
   | `MODEL` | `qwen3.5:9B` | Main chat model |
   | `SUMMARY_MODEL` | same as `MODEL` | Smaller model used for background memory summarization |
   | `ROUTER_EMBED_MODEL` | `paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2` | Override the fastembed model used by `EmbeddingRouter` |
   | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | — | API key (required even for local models) |

3. **Configure `config.yaml`:**

   ```yaml
   domain: "general"
   execute_bash_automatically: false
   router_backend: "embed"
   router_threshold: 0.40
   tray_width_compact: 500
   tray_height_compact: 80
   tray_width_expanded: 500
   tray_height_expanded: 1000
   tray_platform: "xcb"
   tray_position: "bottom-right"
   tray_opacity: "90%"

   # Voice I/O (only used with --voice; ignored otherwise).
   voice:
     wake_word: "hey_jarvis"         # openwakeword built-in or path to .tflite/.onnx
     wake_threshold: 0.5
     stt_model: "small"              # faster-whisper: tiny / base / small / medium / large-v3
     stt_language: "it"              # "auto" or ISO code
     tts_engine: "edge"              # "piper" (local) or "edge" (online, neural)
     tts_voice: "it-IT-IsabellaNeural"
     tts_speed: 1.0
     input_device: "pulse"           # sounddevice id; "pulse" recommended on Linux
     output_device: "pulse"
   ```

   | Key | Default | Description |
   |-----|---------|-------------|
   | `domain` | `"general"` | Active domain (matches filename in `src/domains/`) |
   | `execute_bash_automatically` | `false` | Skip confirmation prompt for shell commands |
   | `router_backend` | `"embed"` | Router backend: `"embed"` (fastembed cosine similarity, default) or `"llm"` (classic LLM classifier) |
   | `router_threshold` | `0.40` | Cosine similarity threshold for `EmbeddingRouter`. Lower = more recall, higher = more precision |
   | `tray_width_compact` | `600` | Compact panel width (px) |
   | `tray_height_compact` | `80` | Compact panel height (px) |
   | `tray_width_expanded` | `900` | Expanded panel width (px) |
   | `tray_height_expanded` | `600` | Expanded panel height (px) |
   | `tray_platform` | `""` | Qt platform backend (`"xcb"` for X11, `""` for default/Wayland) |
   | `tray_position` | `"top-right"` | Window position: `top-left`, `top-center`, `top-right`, `center-left`, `center`, `center-right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-center`, `bottom-right` |
   | `tray_opacity` | `"100%"` | Window opacity (`"0%"` to `"100%"`) |
   | `voice.enabled` | `false` | Enable voice I/O at startup. Can also be toggled at runtime via the tray button |
   | `voice.wake_word` | `"hey_andrew"` | Resolved in this order: (1) openwakeword built-in (`alexa`, `hey_jarvis`, `hey_mycroft`, `hey_rhasspy`), (2) bundled custom model at `src/voice/<name>.onnx` or `.tflite` (the repo ships `hey_andrew.onnx` trained via the openwakeword pipeline), (3) absolute filesystem path to a `.tflite`/`.onnx`. Unknown names fall back to the default with a warning |
   | `voice.wake_threshold` | `0.5` | openwakeword score above which the wake word is considered fired. Lower = more sensitive |
   | `voice.stt_model` | `"small"` | faster-whisper size. `base` is ~2× faster than `small` with slight quality loss; `medium`/`large-v3` impractical on CPU |
   | `voice.stt_language` | `"auto"` | ISO code (`en`, `it`, …) or `"auto"` for Whisper language detection |
   | `voice.tts_engine` | `"piper"` | `"piper"` (local, fast, robotic) or `"edge"` (Microsoft Neural via free Edge endpoint, excellent quality, needs internet) |
   | `voice.tts_voice` | `"en_US-amy-medium"` | Piper: `<lang>_<region>-<speaker>-<quality>` (e.g. `en_US-amy-medium`). Edge: `<lang>-<region>-<name>Neural` (e.g. `it-IT-IsabellaNeural`; full list: `edge-tts --list-voices`) |
   | `voice.tts_speed` | `1.0` | Playback rate multiplier (0.5 = half speed, 2.0 = double) |
   | `voice.input_device` | `null` | sounddevice input id. `"pulse"` routes through PipeWire/PulseAudio and handles resampling; use an integer id from `python -m sounddevice` for a specific device |
   | `voice.output_device` | `null` | sounddevice output id (same conventions as input) |

4. **Run:**

   ```bash
   # CLI mode (default)
   python andrewcli.py

   # CLI with voice (type or say the wake word)
   python andrewcli.py --voice

   # System tray GUI
   python andrewcli.py --tray

   # Tray with voice (panel pops up on wake word)
   python andrewcli.py --tray --voice

   # FastAPI server
   python andrewcli.py --server
   python andrewcli.py --server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9000
   ```

   `--voice` is a **modifier** — it augments whichever primary mode is active. `--tray` and `--server` remain mutually exclusive.

## Interactive Controls

### CLI

| Key | Context | Action |
|-----|---------|--------|
| **TAB** | Input prompt | Cycle to the next available domain |
| **UP / DOWN** | Input prompt | Navigate command history |
| **ESC** | During response | Stop streaming (background tasks still complete) |
| **Wake word** (with `--voice`) | Anywhere in CLI | Trigger STT; prompt line switches to `🎙 listening...` until trailing silence or 8 s cap |

### Tray

| Key / Control | Context | Action |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| **TAB** | Input field | Cycle to the next available domain |
| **Domain button** | Header | Cycle to the next available domain |
| **Stop button** | Header (during generation) | Cancel the current generation (also stops TTS mid-sentence when voice is active) |
| **Clear button** | Header (expanded) | Clear chat view and reset conversation memory |
| **ESC** | Anywhere in panel | Hide the panel window |
| **▽ / △ button** | Header | Toggle between compact and expanded view |
| **Wake word** (with `--voice`) | Anywhere in desktop | Panel auto-opens, status spinner shows `🎙 listening...`, transcribed request submits like a typed message |
| **● Voice / ○ Voice button** (with `--voice`) | Header | Toggle STT on/off (green = listening, grey = paused). When off the wake word is ignored and the mic goes cold immediately, even mid-recording |

## Usage

```
$ python andrewcli.py
Andrew is running...
[general] Ask: Write "hello" to greeting.txt
⠋ Loading: write_file
⠋ Running write_file: greeting.txt
Andrew: File greeting.txt written successfully.
[general] Ask: ↑                          # UP recalls last message
[general] Ask: [TAB]                      # TAB switches domain
Switched to domain: coding
[coding] Ask:

◆ Event [timer]: Fires every N seconds   # event fires in background
Andrew: ...
```

The agent chains tool calls automatically — a skill might instruct the LLM to read a file, transform its contents, and write the result back. The spinner shows which tool is running in real time; model reasoning inside `<think>` tags is displayed in dim italic. Events fire independently in the background and interleave cleanly with user interactions.

With `--voice`, the same CLI accepts typed and spoken prompts interchangeably. Spoken turns are echoed with a `🎙 ` prefix and the assistant's response streams through TTS in parallel with the terminal output:

```
$ python andrewcli.py --voice
Andrew is running (voice on - say 'hey_jarvis' or just type)...
[general] Ask: 🎙 listening...                       # wake word just fired
[general] Ask: 🎙 dimmi l'ora                        # transcribed utterance
Andrew: Sono le diciassette e trenta.                # streams to stdout AND speaker
[general] Ask:
```

## Extending

### Add a new Tool

Create a class that inherits from `Tool` in `src/tools/`:

```python
from src.core.tool import Tool

class MyTool(Tool):
    name: str = "my_tool"
    description: str = "Does something useful."

    def execute(self, arg1: str, arg2: int = 0) -> str:
        return "result"
```

Import and add `MyTool()` to your domain's `tools` list.

### Add a new Skill

1. Create a markdown file in `src/skills/skills_files/`:

   ```markdown
   ---
   name: my_skill
   description: What this skill does
   tools: [tool_name_1, tool_name_2]
   ---

   # Instructions
   1. Step one
   2. Step two
   ```

   `tools:` is optional — list any tools the skill requires that the router might not select automatically.

2. Create a `Skill` subclass in `src/skills/myskills.py` and add it to your domain's `skills` list:

   ```python
   from src.core.skill import Skill

   class MySkill(Skill):
       skill_file: str = "my_skill.md"
   ```

### Add a new Domain

Create a file in `src/domains/` (e.g. `research.py`):

```python
from src.core.domain import Domain

class ResearchDomain(Domain):
    system_prompt: str = "You are a research assistant."
    tools: list = []
    skills: list = []
    events: list = []
```

Set `domain: "research"` in `config.yaml`. The file name must match the config value; the class must be named `<Name>Domain`.

### Add a new Event

Create a file in `src/events/` (e.g. `my_event.py`):

```python
import asyncio
from src.core.event import Event

class MyEvent(Event):
    name = "my_event"
    description = "Short description shown in notifications"
    message = "Prompt sent to the agent when this event fires."

    async def condition(self):
        await asyncio.sleep(60)  # block until condition is met

    async def trigger(self):
        pass  # optional side-effect before the agent message
```

Add it to your domain:

```python
from src.events.my_event import MyEvent

events: list = [MyEvent()]
```
