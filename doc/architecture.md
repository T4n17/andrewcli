# Architecture

## Project Structure

AndrewCLI separates **shipped code** (the Python package) from **runtime configuration** (domains, events, the global `config.yaml`). Runtime configuration lives under `~/.config/andrewcli/` and is seeded from bundled defaults the first time `andrewcli` runs, so the user can edit, add, or remove domains and events without touching the installed package.

## Config

A centralized `Config` class (`src/shared/config.py`) loads `~/.config/andrewcli/config.yaml` and exposes settings as attributes. Used by `app.py` to select the active domain, and by the tray app for window dimensions, position, opacity, and platform backend.

On first import, `src/shared/paths.py` seeds `~/.config/andrewcli/` from the package's bundled defaults (`src/defaults/`) and inserts that directory at the front of `sys.path`, so `domains.<name>` and `events.<name>` resolve as regular Python packages no matter where AndrewCLI is installed.

---

## Domains

A **Domain** is a folder under `~/.config/andrewcli/domains/<name>/` that groups a system prompt, tools, and skills into a single persona. There is no per-domain Python class — every domain is pure configuration:

- **Settings** — loaded from `domains/<name>/config.yaml`. Any key set there overrides the matching key from the global `config.yaml` while this domain is active; missing keys fall through to the global value, then to the class-level default. Recognized keys: `api_base_url`, `model`, `routing_enabled`.
- **System prompt** — loaded from `domains/<name>/system_prompt.md`. Plain markdown, no frontmatter.
- **Tools** — auto-discovered from `domains/<name>/tools/*.py` (every concrete `Tool` subclass is instantiated and registered).
- **Skills** — auto-discovered from `domains/<name>/skills/*.md`.

All four are **reloaded before every user turn** via `Domain.reload()`. Tool modules are re-imported with `importlib.reload`, skill files are re-scanned from disk, the system prompt and `config.yaml` are re-read. Flipping `routing_enabled` or pointing the domain at a new endpoint takes effect immediately — no restart required. If `api_base_url` or `model` changes, a new LLM client is created and the existing conversation memory is transplanted into it. Memory and the event bus are never touched by a reload.

The active domain is chosen from the global `config.yaml` (`domain: "general"`) and can be **switched at runtime** with TAB. Domains can optionally override the global LLM endpoint and model per-domain.

Each domain owns an `EventBus` instance that starts empty — events are independent of domains and are added at runtime through slash commands.

---

## Tools

A **Tool** is a Python class the LLM can call. Tools auto-generate their OpenAI function schema from `execute()`'s type hints — no manual schema boilerplate. The base `Tool.run()` wrapper catches exceptions and returns a `[Tool Error]` string so the agent can recover without crashing.

**Built-in tools** (`~/.config/andrewcli/domains/general/tools/`): `WriteFile`, `ReadFile`, `ExecuteCommand`, `GetCurrentDate`. Every shell command is spawned with `cwd=LAUNCH_DIR` so `execute_command` always targets the directory you launched `andrewcli` from.

---

## Skills

A **Skill** is a markdown-defined tool. Instead of executing code, it returns natural-language instructions the LLM follows using the available tools. Skill files live inside each domain's `skills/` folder and are auto-loaded as `Skill` instances — no Python subclass needed. Each file starts with a YAML frontmatter block:

```markdown
---
name: my_skill
description: What this skill does
tools: [tool_name_1, tool_name_2]
---

# Instructions
1. Step one using the available tools
2. Step two using the available tools
```

The optional `tools:` field lists tools the skill requires — they are injected into the generation call even if the router didn't select them.

When the LLM invokes a skill, its body is **promoted into the system prompt** as a turn-scoped `<skill:NAME>...</skill:NAME>` block. The tool-call response is just a short acknowledgement pointing the model at the new system instructions. This puts skill steps at the same authority tier as the domain's base system prompt — far stickier than embedding them in a `role: tool` message, where local models tend to summarize or skip steps. The block is cleared in a `try/finally` at turn end so it never leaks into the next turn's routing or context.

---

## UI Layer

- **`Spinner`** (`animations.py`) — async spinner with a dynamic `.status` property. Shows what the agent is doing: `⠴ Thinking...`, `⠧ Running execute_command: ls -la`, `⠋ Loading: write_file, read_file`.
- **`ThinkFilter`** (`filter.py`) — streaming parser for `<think>...</think>` tags. Handles tags split across token boundaries. Renders reasoning in dim italic while keeping the final answer in normal text.
- **`StreamRenderer`** (`renderer.py`) — orchestrates the full output pipeline: spinner lifecycle, `RouteEvent` and `ToolEvent` processing, think filtering, typewriter-effect streaming, ESC-to-stop.

---

## Tray App

A **PyQt6 system tray application** that uses the same domain classes and async logic as the CLI. `app.py` is a thin shell that constructs the `QApplication` and delegates all orchestration to `TrayController` (`controller.py`).

- **`controller.py`** — handles domain loading, `StreamWorker` lifecycle, and the event bridge.
- **`worker.py`** — `StreamWorker` QThread runs `domain.generate()` on a shared asyncio event loop via `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`. Emits `token_received`, `tool_status`, `finished`, and `error` signals. Cancellation cancels the asyncio future and sets a flag checked during streaming.
- **`panel.py`** — `ChatPanel` with a `QLineEdit` input, `QTextBrowser` for streamed markdown output, and header controls. Braille spinner driven by `QTimer` shows tool names during execution and routing. Conversation history is persisted to `$LAUNCH_DIR/.andrewcli/data/conversation.md` and restored on next launch.
- **Event bridge** — the `EventBus` runs on the shared asyncio loop. A `queue.SimpleQueue` bridges it to the Qt main thread. A `QTimer` polling at 100 ms drains the queue, shows balloon notifications via `QSystemTrayIcon.showMessage`, and routes tokens to the panel — all without blocking the Qt or asyncio loops.
- Submitting a new message while generating **cancels the previous generation** and waits before starting a new one.

---

## Async Pipeline

The entire I/O pipeline is non-blocking:

1. **`andrewcli.py`** — runs under `asyncio.run()`. Input read via a custom async `_read_input()` using cbreak mode, supporting TAB and UP/DOWN history.
2. **Router** — async LLM-as-classifier call that returns the minimal tool/skill set for the prompt.
3. **Spinner** — `asyncio` task that animates and updates status text from `RouteEvent` and `ToolEvent`s.
4. **Streaming** — `LLM.generate()` is an async generator. Tokens are yielded as they arrive. `ToolEvent` objects are also yielded to update the spinner.
5. **Tool calls** — accumulated from streamed chunks, executed via `tool.run()`, looped back automatically. Malformed JSON arguments are caught and reported instead of crashing.
6. **Memory summarization** — fires in the background after the response completes; no user-facing delay. Skipped entirely for short turns.
7. **Event bus** — runs as a set of concurrent asyncio tasks alongside the main loop. Each event waits on its own `condition()` coroutine independently, then acquires `Domain.busy_lock` to dispatch (FIFO across events and user turns).

---

## Server

The FastAPI server (`src/core/server.py`) is a **thin middleware**: it does not call the LLM directly. `POST /chat` enqueues the message into a shared bridge inbox and returns a `session_id`; the CLI/tray picks it up within 100 ms and processes it through the normal submit path — the same code path as a typed message, so slash commands, events, and the full domain pipeline all work identically over HTTP. Response tokens are accumulated in a per-session store and returned via `GET /chat/{session_id}` (tokens are consumed on each call; poll until `done: true`).

The CLI and tray automatically start the FastAPI server in a background thread on launch (configurable via `server.enabled` in `config.yaml`). `andrewcli --server` starts the server standalone without a UI.

All three surfaces (CLI, system tray, HTTP API) share the same core: same domains, same memory, same router, and the same `Domain.busy_lock` that serializes user turns and event dispatches identically on every surface.
